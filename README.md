# ChristianB-NEA-project-
C#, documentation and SQL proficiency evidence.
#
This is the code for my NEA for my A levels end of course project.

This code shows proficiency in SQL requests to both recieve data from a database, the creation of new tables and the filling of those tables with data
This code shows proficincy in C# in its overall design as well as complex algoritms being shown the the polynomial regresion side of the project.
The attached document shows documentation skills as the entire inseption, analysis and creation of the program is documented in 200 pages.

I completed a Ecommerce processing and analysis project which is on a Guithub repository found on my resume. The project interacts with a SQL database requesting a huge product sales table. It then completes data analysis and table breakdowns to create important data like "overall spending of each user found" and "money made each day". it then creates these tables within the SQL database and fills them with the data created.

a separate program then conducts further data analysis including basic linear regression as well as polynomial linear regression. The project then compares the models to see which type of graph represents the data better through R squared analysis. It then creates a per user graph which can be used to predict each users future spending filling a table on the SQL db with this data.

Then a dashboard is used to present the findings of this data. This dashboard allows the dashboard user to query for a specific shop user's graph showing the prediction for this user. It also shows the trends of spending throughout the year. This project uses C# and SQL
