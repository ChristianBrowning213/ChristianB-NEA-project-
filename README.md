# ChristianB-NEA-project-
C#, documentation and SQL proficiency evidence.
#
This is the code for my NEA for my A levels end of course project.

This code shows proficiency in SQL requests to both recieve data from a database, the creation of new tables and the filling of those tables with data
This code shows proficincy in C# in its overall design as well as complex algoritms being shown the the polynomial regresion side of the project.
The attached document shows documentation skills as the entire inseption, analysis and creation of the program is documented in 200 pages.

the project interacts with a SQL database requesting a huge product sales table. It then places this within a dataframe. It then completes data analysis and table breakdowns to create important data like "overall spending of each user found" and "money made each day". it then creates these tables within the SQL database and fills them with the data created.

a separate program then conducts further data analysis including basic linear regression as well as polynomial linear regression. The project then compares the models to see which type of graph represents the data better through R squared analysis. It then creates a table field with these values and uses SQL to fill a table with this data.

Then a dashboard is used to present the findings of this data.
